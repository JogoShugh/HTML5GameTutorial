title: HTML5 Game Development Tutorial
---

When I put a simple 80 line platformer up on the [Quintus Website](http://html5quintus.com), I was aware that people would probably use that example as a starter for platformer games with the Quintus Engine. What I didn't realize is that people would **only** use that example and build pretty much nothing but platformers with the Engine.

This tutorial is an attempt to fix that problem by showing the Engine used to build 9 different games. Furthermore the point of the tutorial is to show you that how subtle the implementation differences between different genres of games are - take a top down RPG-like game, add gravity and you have a side scroller. Take a 2D runner game, remove gravity, and suddenly you have a 2D space shooter. 

This tutorial will assume some basic familiarity with Quintus - so if you haven't read through the [Quintus Guide](http://html5quintus.com/guide/intro.md), I recommend you do that now (even just to give it a quick scan)

Additionally, the hope is that by playing with various pieces of the engines to build games in a gaggle of genres, you'll feel more comfortable with breaking out of specific genres of games and create the next indie world-beater.

The links below will get filled in as each part of the tutorial is completed.

* Game #2: Top-down Rogue RPG
* Game #3: Side-scrolling shooter
* Game #4: Endless Runner
* Game #5: Spaceship shooter
* Game #6: 3D Spaceship Shooter
* Game #7: 2D Physics Roller
* Game #8: 3D Physics Roller
* Game #9: Artillery Shooter



Without further ado, let's get going with a Quintus knock-off of the first game I ever remember playing: Pac Man.
