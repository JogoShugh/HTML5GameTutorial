When I put a simple 80 line platformer up on the HTML5Quintus Website, I was aware that people would probably use that example as a starter for platformer games with the Quintus Engine. What I didn't realize is that people would **only** use that example and build pretty much nothing but platformers with the Engine.

This tutorial is an attempt to fix that problem by showing the Engine used to build 9 different games. Furthermore the point of the tutorial is to show you that how subtle the implementation differences between different genres of games are - take a top down RPG-like game, add gravity and you have a side scroller. Take a 2D runner game, remove gravity, and suddenly you have a 2D space shooter. 

This tutorial will assume some basic familiarity with Quintus - so if you haven't read through the Quintus Guide, I recommend you do that now.

Additionaly, the hope is that by playing with various pieces of the engines to float between genres, you'll feel more comfortable with breaking out of specific genres of games and create the next indie world-beater.

Without further ado, let's get going with a Quintus knock-off of game that started it all for me: Pac Man.




Pac Man is the first game that I remember playing, first in the arcade and then at home on the Atari as a wee tike, so let's start there.

Game: Tower Man
Genre: Top-down action
Clone of: Pac Man

First a moment of reflection on the Genre: what is a Pac Man type game? The answer is that it's a top-down action game. A player moves in fixed 2D board while enemies chase him in real-time.

Our clone, Tower Man, will be different than Pac Man in a number of ways, but the main gameplay experience will be the same.

The 9 Game Tutorial

- Start with a 2D pac-man type game where the player is always moving

- Switch to a simple top-down Rogue RPG

- Diversion: Turn into an isometric adventure game (need to add isometric tiles in)

- Change to a simple side scrolling shooter

- Turn it into an endless runner 
(get rid of enemies, make the player always run)

- Change it to a spaceship game runner flies

- Change it to a 3D spaceship game, use 3D models and Three.js

- Change it to a sphere Box2D game

-Change it to a 3d Sphere box2D game
